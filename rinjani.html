                                <hr />
								<p>Last year, I embarked on my first solo summit attack journey to Mount Kinabalu. The first experience was always an exciting one, you can find it in the link <a href = "https://nawatkaw.github.io/resume/kotakinabalu.html" ><b>here</b></a> It sparked my interest to go see the world, and that motivated me to explore further once again. However, this time, it is not traveling alone at the same location, but with friends. My friends and I decided to tackle Mount Rinjani in Lombok, Indonesia, with the altitude of 3.7 km</p>
								<p>Many people told me it is deemed as the notoriously difficult mountain to summit, due to the difficult terrain slope. I have seen many of my friends have gone and they made it back safely,  and I want to be up for the challenge. </p>
                                <p>For this time, I am more motivated to explore this adventure with my friends. We signed up with SoTravel, an agency that offers adventure trip packages catered towards young adults in 20s.  My friends have gone for other trips under this package and was told to be a very good experience. Hence, I was persuaded to try it also. </p>
								<p>For this time, unfortunately, once again, I still did not prepare myself well for the trip, by only training via weekly Dragonboat training session. I went in with the mindset was hoping for the best. </p>
								<h3>Have anxiety but much lesser</h3>
								<p>Prior to the climb, I started noticing myself become more anxious – butterflies in my stomach, and more heavy heart pounding. It was déjà vu. Having gone through one same experience last year, I was more composed and able to calm myself down. I told myself to just give it my best shot, and accept whatever result it will be. </p>

								<h3>Trail Overview</h3>
								<p>There are many ways to get to the base camp and then the summit. We took a 4D3N route, going to Torrean, and climbing for about 6 hours up to base camp. Summit attack at 2 am, to reach summit before sunrise. Then coming down to Segare Anak Lake (Crater Lake), then down to the Starting point at Desa Torrean. It was deemed as the more chilled itinerary compared to the other trips (2D1N / 3D2N)</p>

								<h3>Day 0: We are going on a trip </h3>
								<p>It was a lot of road trips and plane trips, with 3 hours commuting both on train and car. We sat along the windy road until my butt was aching. We were greeted by the lodge’s owner who explained to us what to expect for the climb. The rest of the night was packing, and calming myself down for the climb.</p>

								<p>Mandatory photo taking, and we are ready to go. Our hike started at 10 am. Within the SoTravel traveling group, we are hiking together with other hikers who have more experienced and physically fit during the hike. Some have tackled other challenging trails, such as Everest Base Camp, while some just got back from another Mountain hike, but are still ready to continue. </p>
								<p>We continue hiking from starting point to Pos 1 to Pos 2 before stopping for lunch. The terrain is different from Kota Kinnabalu. This trail is a path with slopes going up and down, while in Kota Kinnabalu is just stairs going up.</p>

								<p> I had been noticing that  I started groaning and dreading when the path was going down. Looking back, I was amused with the response I made because I personally wanted to quickly reach the top. I realized that I was expecting myself to quickly reach the endpoint, without enjoying the journey along the way. The pace climb was slightly faster compared to when I was hiking alone and hence made me tired more easily. And also, maybe I was not training much in climbing up the mountain.</p>
								<p>By 12 pm, we have reached Pos2 and we are having lunch. The lunch was more nutritious than back in Mount Kinabalu. For every group climb, there will be porters helping to carry items up to the mountain. During 4D3N, they assist in building up tents and keeping the hikers well fed preparing for the hike constantly. Hence, during the hike, we were awarded soft drinks, snacks, main course, and dessert throughout the hike. I am still amazed at the amount of effort they have put in.</p>

								<p>The terrain gets steeper and steeper. Some of the path sections were very sandy and rocky. We have to stretch our legs for each big jump. Thankfully, I have my walking poles as my partner in crime. Surprisingly, during the journey, it benefited me a lot as additional legs for the climb.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, it can only help so far. As I try to take a big step hike up, my quads start to cramp up, and the muscles tense up until it hurts. This made me reduce my hiking speed and made me slow down a bit. Nevertheless, I pushed on until I reached the last checkpoint, Pos4.</p>

								<p>From Pos4 to Basecamp, it was a short lateral distance hike, but the altitude change was big. The terrain was about 30-35 degrees steep, with a path full of sand. The picture may not show justice, but trust me it was steep. It is easy for us to hike and slide down. Despite wearing hiking shoes, it may not be helpful in all situations. There were times that I slid down, but was able to stop myself with my hands. I am grateful that it didn’t rain throughout the hike, as it would be more drastic. </p>
								<p>Other hikers also experience the same struggle, where they may unexpectedly slide down while climbing. They were all panting and gasping for air. As I climbed up and eventually overtook the other hikers, I kept on cheering them on and saying “You can do it”, as we were climbing. </p>

								<h3>Summit attack part 1 – Headlamps light up the street</h3>
								<p>It was 1.30 am, and It was time to summit attack. Have a decent breakfast with Cup noodles and hot water to keep ourselves warm and under the stars. It was a while before we went into the unknown! </p>
								<p>It was dark and cold and windy at 2 am, but a trail of light from our headlamps was the only thing that guided the rocky path up. It was exciting but at the same time tiring. I tried to control my breathing, in through nose and out through my mouth. Others were doing the same. It was about 1.1km elevation, 300m more than the summit attack climb in Mount Kinabalu. There was only one way up to the summit, and about 200 people were climbing on that day. It was a crowded path. </p>

								<p>The terrain was mainly full of dusty sand, and it made us slide down after every step we took. Not to mention that there were many steep path to walk through. I took step by step, and we all tried to find our path to go up. My main goal was to follow the same pace as the person in front and climb. That was my only strategy, to not make me slow down and lose pace. No signs were telling us how long did we had left, we could only rely on the guide. He would often say “2 hours more to go”, “1.5 hours more to go”. I do wish he would change it to remaining distance. I just visualize on my own that we are halfway completed, although I don’t even know if it is a true half distance.</p>

								<p>The only time I felt happy while attacking the summit was when the group decided to rest. During that time, I developed a routine. Sit down, remove my bags from my shoulder, drink 3 sips of water, and breathe. Each rest was about 4-5 minutes long, to not entirely cool down our body as it is much more difficult to get back up. I have learned that I should not drink too much water, as the water available for me is limited, only prepared 1 liter for the summit attack (including up and down). Besides fighting with the sandy terrain, thin air, and strong wind, there was another hurdle that I had to overcome</p>
								<h3>Summit attack part 2 – @5.45am, I ALMOST gave up</h3>
								<p>Mother nature can be both nice and scary at the same time. At high altitudes, it is mainly scary, in my opinion. In Mount Rinjani, besides getting through sandy terrain, thin air, and strong wind, I have to face high altitude and narrow path. The path to the summit has no obstruction to reduce the wind speed, which means I receive the full effect of strong wind up in the mountain. This is coupled with a cliff narrow path, that got me overwhelmed with every step I take. I almost pee-ed my pants. </p>
								<p>At 5.45 am, the sun began to rise, it was getting brighter. I was left with 1.5 hours more of hiking. I didn’t make it to the summit before the sunrise. It is fine. At the checkpoint resting, I turned forward to see the path in front of me. It was a 30-degree steep path with loose rocks and pebbles terrain and a narrow path with no wind obstruction. I was thinking of backing out and giving up. </p>

								<p>From the base camp up to the summit, I often saw a lot of people coming back down at 4 am. I also see them just lie down flat along the path. I was thinking I want to be like those – to just call it quit and admire the sunrise from here. I was way too afraid of fighting against Mother Nature to go up to the summit. I realized that the path was getting more and more dangerous, with strong winds coupled with a narrow cliff path. One misstep and disaster may occur. I did not want to be one of those potential disaster, and I felt it was not worth it. </p>

								<p>However, my body was telling me differently. I saw my friends were all getting up and going to climb, so I decided to try on a bit and re-consider at the next checkpoint. The wind was still very strong, it could even move me. Once I felt I was being moved by the wind, I froze myself and ground myself as much before I continued again. I also try to walk within the center of the path to prevent myself from being too near the cliff. It was torturous walking along that. By this time, I had covered 3 quarter of the climb, but I was left with the toughest climb in the final quarter</p>
								<h3>7.15am, I made it </h3>
								<p>I still follow the same procedure – walking behind someone and maintaining the same distance, looking down, and freezing myself when the stronger winds blew (which occurred very frequently). At the last 100 meters, I could see the endpoint. That was when my adrenaline rush was the highest. I started shouting to myself every step I took – “Good job Nawat, a little bit more”, “One more step, and we are closer to the end”. Basically, I was hyping myself at every step I took. Surprisingly, the path was not that crowded as it got closer to the summit, so it was less intimidating than not having enough space to climb. After many rounds of hyping, I eventually made it up to the summit. </p>

								<P>The sun was shining bright, and the wind was strong, but the view was stunning. Quite pretty. We did the same thing as other hikers – sat down, took many breaths, and recorded myself at the top of the mountain. This is all before, I was thinking : how to get down here. </P>


								<h3>Part 1 completed</h3>
								<p>I would not say I was as amazed when I summitted as my first solo summit attack at Kota Kinabalu, as I know that I can do it. However, I am amazed at how I see some mental toughness techniques (Goal setting, Positive thinking) were able to overcome my body’s strength and summit this mountain.</p>

								<p>I am proud that I completed my main quest for this trip – summit attack. However, this is not the end of my journey. There are many more exciting stories to be shared as I was going down. I shall save it in another blog. </p>

								<h3>Even though half of my hike has been completed, I have managed to encapsulate some life lessons which are good reminders to both the audience and me. </h3>
								<h4>1.	Celebrate small wins, celebrate small wins</h4>
								<p>Having the goal to summit any mountain is always an ambitious goal. It is important to break those goals into small wins to keep ourselves motivated. My strategy was to break into a portion of the overall hike. For example, hiking up to base camp can be broken down into 4 sections, with each section meaning reaching individual checkpoints. </p>
								<p>I always aim to reach the checkpoint, as I can take this chance as a reward to put down my bags and drink 5 sips of water. Turns out, it was an effective strategy that I used in my summit attack as well. </p>

										</div>

									</div>

								</section>
								<h4>2.	Not ready, just do it. Trust yourself, cause you got you</h4>
								<p>It seems that at the end of the day, it is all about mind games. It is all about the mental strength to push you forward when your body tells you it is not. But we can just take small steps first, to try first, and we re-evaluate. Somehow, from my experience, I didn’t re-evaluate to cancel the summit but instead went forward to reach it. I am glad I took that first step to get up, pick up my bag and walking stick and take the first step. Even if it was following someone’s footsteps during the climb, at least I took that first step.</p>
								<p><b>If you didn’t take that first step, you won’t get this view and experience!</b></p>
