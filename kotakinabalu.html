                                <hr />
								<p>Trekking or walking in nature has been one of the things I enjoy doing in my free time. I have come across enjoying this activity after my Nepal trip and the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic required most of us to be creative about how we can occupy our free time within Singapore. I went trekking at many places in Singapore such as The Rail Corridor, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and The Treetop Walk. It feels liberating and free to step away from city scenery and just stay in nature.</p>

							<p> However, when the international restrictions between countries were lifted. I realised that was a desire in me to see more of the world. I conducted my search with the following criteria in mind. It needs to be overseas as I want to see the world, and it needs to be near Singapore and common as it will be my solo trip. Many of my friends and colleagues have gone to Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, and successfully tackle the summit. I decided to take a leap of faith. Furthermore, it is easier to engage with an agency when hiking at Kota Kinabalu who assist in arranging all the accommodation and ferry to the locations.</p>


                                <h3>Not much preparation, but much anxiety</h3>
								<p>Before the trip, I did not have additional physical preparations. I was currently doing Dragonboat training once a week and thought it is sufficient cardio for this adventure. I figured to have as many hours of sleep as much as possible before the start of the trip. However, before the trip, I started to experience travel anxiety. I unknowingly developed migraines and gastric the week of flying. Furthermore, I felt there were a lot of butterflies in my stomach and my mind was constantly thinking if I would survive this trip alone. I seek the internet for help and found many resources to help me calm now. I was surprised and felt assured as I am not the only one going through this anxiety journey. Looking back, it is much more understandable to have all the nerves since this is my first-ever solo trip and my first-ever trekking trip. </p>

								<p>The nervousness carried with me from the start of the week to when I land at Kota Kinabalu International Airport. It was raining heavily and I was informed that it has been raining for the last 4 hours when I landed. I was genuinely worried as the next day will be the start of my hiking. I try to get much rest as possible at a hostel before the real adventure begins.</p>
								<h3>Trail Overview</h3>
								<p>The entire route to reach the summit is approximately 8.5km distance over an elevation of 2.2km. Day 1 requires us to trek for 6km up to the Panalaban Basecamp resting at 3.3km altitude, before attacking the summit at 2.30 am and continuing to summit at 4.095km altitude, over the distance of 8.5km. I was traveling together with the mountain guide, and only 2 of us attacked the summit. Being the only trail going upwards, I will be trekking alongside other mountain climbers who are constantly going up and down the mountain.</p>

								<h3>It's time to begin, isn't it?</h3>
								<p> The following day, the company ferried a van to pick me up from my hostel to the Kinabalu Park headquarters, located 2 hours away from the city. The weather was chilly at the park and got me worried about climbing in a single-layer dry-fit t-shirt and shorts. However, I was not worrying much and was only thinking about reaching the base camp.</p>

								<p>I was paired up with a mountain guide who advises me to hike up at the speed of 1km/h, so as not to injure myself. I continue trekking at my comfortable pace, and constantly take photos at every checkpoint to commemorate myself and have something to look forward to every kilometre. Upon trekking, the slopes turn into stairs and I was encountering many steep stairs before me with slippery and a narrow path. I was thankful that I brought my walking sticks with me as it did help to lessen the impact on my lower body.</p>

								<h3>Exhausted, Cramps and Cold</h3>
								<p> Halfway into trekking, at around 3.5km, I began to feel more exhausted and dreaded climbing stairs. I started singing songs to keep myself going, and walking at a slower pace. Unfortunately, that was when the rain starts to drizzle and the temperature was much colder. </p>

								<p> I tried rushing to reach the 4km checkpoint by 12.15 pm, where I had my lunch. At the checkpoints, there were many hikers before me having their lunch and resting. I was one of those. We were all standing under the open-air shelter with strong winds, in our raincoats eating cold chicken wings. I began to feel dreaded and wanted it to end faster. I started preparing myself for cold weather hiking, with a windbreaker and heat pads ready, and a raincoat just in case. Thankfully when starting hiking for the next 2km, the rain stopped and we were above rain clouds. I was greeted by a beautiful view and that motivated me to push on the last 2km, which were all uneven layers of rock steps, hence increasing climbing difficulty.</p>

								<h3>Made it for Day 1, yay!</h3>
								<p>After 5 hours later, I made it to the base camp. It was surprising that I reached the hostel for the night faster than expected. The view was spectacular with a sea of clouds. The weather was not cold, it was 15.5C, motivating me to walk around and take as many photos as I can.</p>

								<p>After settling into the hostel, I did some journaling by the window of clouds view while drinking the most expensive Milo that I had drank, 15MYR. At the base camp, I have gotten to interact with many hikers, both local and international. Some hikers came back for a second time because they did not reach the summit the first time due to bad weather conditions and stamina. Some people were amateur hikers like me, wanting to challenge themselves, and came with their friends. From my observation, there are no amateur hikers who were here alone, but were all with their friends/families. I was shocked to see that some hikers are in their late 50s but are still physically fit to climb this mountain. I was humbled and respected for their dedication to reach the summit.</p>

								<h3> People were going to bed, we were getting ready</h3>
								<p>It was 2.30 am and all of us were in our night climbing gear, getting ready for the second part of our expedition – the summit attack. I realized some of my friends were online, so I had a chat with them before they go to bed. It was raining throughout the whole night, and we were all anxiously waiting to start our hike. </p>

								<p>Many hikers were worried that they would hike down to Headquarters feeling disappointed for not accomplishing their goals. Meanwhile, I was feeling cold and sleepy, I begin to dread the expedition as I felt accomplished for reaching 3.2km altitude the day before. However, the surrounding adrenaline rush was pushing me to continue with other hikers and reach the summit too. Due to bad weather conditions, the hike was postponed to 3.30 am before being allowed to attack.</p>

								<h3>A Race against time</h3>
								<p>We have only 2 hours to hike till the last checkpoint at the 7km mark. All hikers must cross the checkpoint by 5.30 am, to qualify for reaching the summit. If hikers did not reach by that time, they cannot continue the route and must turn back. We have to trek for 1km up an altitude of 700m in a single-digit temperature with strong winds blowing. I was preparing myself to the max with 5 layers of clothes (I get cold very easily), and some heat pads and gloves to prepare for my hike. The trek was constantly climbing stairs and rope pulling due to its steep slope. We were all trekking in the dark, with only our headlamps as our navigating light. It was completely pitch black, I could only see a few steps in front of me. As it was raining over the night, the climbing ropes were wet and my gloves were not waterproof. Hence, the heat pads did not help me, and my hands were numb while holding onto the rope. It was painful. Many hikers eventually overtook me as I was adjusting myself to climbing in this weather condition. I tried to focus on myself and continue climbing at the same pace. At 5.15 am, I made it to the 7km checkpoint at 3.67km altitude. I was proud of my achievement so far, but I know it’s not the end yet. I was preparing to attack the summit. I got all my gears ready – changing the heat pads and hydrating myself.</p>

								<h3>I can't breathe fully</h3>
								<p>It was 5.20 am, and it was still pitch black. The slope was steep at approximately a 50-degree incline. I had to rely on a single rope to pull myself up. At high altitudes, the oxygen became less saturated. Thankfully, throughout the trip, I had been taking high altitude sickness pill, hence helped me with not experiencing symptoms such as headache and nausea. However, during the hike, I did not control my breathing well. I was panting after taking every 5 steps up, and resting and repeat. There were times I could not take a deep breath to fill my lungs, causing me to panic much faster and gasping for air. I had to set aside and rest many times before continuing. I still had the energy to continue climbing.</p>

								</section>

								<p>.At the 7.3km mark, the path was still constantly climbing up with no signs of the slope being gentler. This coupled with strong winds that were constantly blowing at me, and my hands feeling super numb till they hurt from my climb. I began to feel demoralized and made me question why I am doing here in this cold weather while I constantly face difficulty breathing. At that moment, in the heated moment, I want to turn back and give up entirely. Upon hearing that in my head, I calm myself down and asked my mountain guide the remaining distance. I was left with 1.2km more to go, so I made a point to re-evaluate my decision in the next 200m, and I continued walking.</p>

								<p>Fortunately, it was around 6 am and the sky was getting brighter. I turn my head around and was able to see the beautiful view down below. It helped me to see that I am close to the endpoint, so I tried further, but I told myself to take a slower pace. The slope was getting less steep, hence I did not rely on climbing rope anymore and just continue as normal walking. Before I knew it, I was already at the 8km mark and felt I was mentally ready to attack the summit. I knew I can do it, only 500m more to go.</p>
								<h3>I'm on top of the world, hey!</h3>
								<p>At around 6.45am, I reached the summit, at the altitude of 4095m above sea water, at Southeast Asia’s highest peak. Even though it was just only 2.5 km hike, it took me close to 4 hours to reach the summit. I tried to admire the view and take videos of myself sending to my friends that I made it. </p>

								</section>

								<p>However, I did not stay up for long and decided to descend immediately because there were too many people at the peak. Furthermore, I had to check out of the hostel by 10.30 am and reach the headquarter by 4 pm, hence it is a race against time once again. However, even though, it was a race against time, I try to document the journey going down as much as I can, and visualize myself climbing up to the summit in the darkness. It was not an easy task, and I am so happy that I made it.</p>

								<h3>It's time to begin (again), isn't it?</h3>
								<p>Reaching the base camp, I had my quick heavy breakfast and packed my stuff saying farewell to the place. Wrote a postcard to myself to remind me of the adventure that I went through that time, and made it out. And starting my 6km hike down.</p>

								<p>The hike took 5 hours same as hiking up, but I felt hiking down was much easier than hiking up. However, I did not feel any tiredness when climbing down, which I believe must be due to the adrenaline coming down again. On the journey down, I often walked past the hikers who were hiking up to the base camp, I try to encourage them to push a bit more till reached the checkpoint. I also share with them some experiences when attacking the summit with humility. While hiking down, I had a conversation with a lady who was hiking down together with me. She did not make it to the summit as she had to take care of her sister who was very anxious about climbing at high altitudes in the dark. She was a bit disappointed about not securing the summit, but I assure her that she had already done a good job in reaching the base camp of 6km. Being an amateur hiker myself, it is indeed very challenging to have constant stamina and push yourself up to the base camp. I think this is a good reminder for me and many others to take note of the progress that they have made instead of focusing on the final goal only.</p>

								<p>I continue to descend, and I was confused why the trek is so long. As I reached my last km hike, my legs began to feel weaker but I continue. Nevertheless, I continued my hiking and talking to the mountain guide to keep me distracted, and I eventually made it back to the starting point!</p>

								<h3>What a ride</h3>
								<p>It has already been one month since this trip. As I start to write it out in black and white, it helps me to account for all these memories and small pockets of lessons that I crystalized after my hiking trip. Being on a solo trip, I have a lot of time for myself. This allows me to be in my thoughts a lot. As I was descending, I was deep in my thoughts while walking, trying to process what have I learned from these experiences. Here are some of the takeaways that I got from this mountaineering expedition.</p>
								<h2>Lesson Learn</h2>
								<h3>1. Remember the highlights but don’t forget the lows </h3>
								<p>Many journeys that we have gone through in life have both ups and downs. When I recounted my previous journey, I often share with others only the highlights of the trip/journey. I often neglect or ignore the bad moments altogether.</p>
								<p>I notice that upon sharing my low moments during the trip with others, I felt a sense of pride in myself. Those low moments have already occurred in the past, but I manage to overcome those and openly share those experiences to others. Also, the story becomes more interesting when there is a mixture of highlights and lowlights. It is similar to many movies that we have watched. The plots become more interesting once there were some character development upon going through hardship. These hardships, albeit tough and demoralising, they made the movie characters (ie. Me in this case) become who they are.
									Hence, whenever I get to share my story, I would share the highs and lows of the journey that I’ve faced</p>

								<h3>2. It’s okay going back at my own pace, as everybody carries different struggles and responsibilities </h3>
								<p>The hiking was a difficult journey for everybody, both the experienced and non-experienced hikers. As I have talked to some hikers, some have decided to come back for the second time due to not being able to tackle the summit by sunrise. Some hikers, with different health conditions, have decided to see reaching the summit not as their priority. My goal was somewhere in the middle. I was determined to reach the summit, but not within a stipulated time. I am contented as long as I have secured the summit.</p>
								<p>During my summit attack at 3.30 am, I was the first few to set off to start the hiking journey. Due to its narrow path, we were all climbing the stairs in a single file. As it was a long distance, at a high altitude, my pace started to drop and hence increased the gap between the person in front and me. Some people have decided to overtake me and continued their climb. I was initially affected by how I am losing out to others who were ahead of me. However, I had a realisation that this hiking journey is similar to life.</p>

								<p>All of us are working on the same hiking path called life. Some people may be traveling at a slower pace due to different struggles/responsibilities that they have to carry. This is similar to a few hikers who had different medical conditions, but still decided to climb, or had to take care of their friends/families who were hiking with them. With these responsibilities along the journey, they have to slow down their pace, and may hence have different goals, and thus may not need to reach the summit. From this realisation, it got me thinking to myself. Considering this is my first time hiking a mountain, I may not be as physically fit as other seasonal hikers, hence causing my pace to be slower than theirs. Upon realisation of my current cards that I am dealt with, I was not very affected when many hikers overtook me. Instead, I happily let them overtake me, as I know that I am giving my best in fighting my own battle attempting to reach the summit at my own pace.</p>

								<h3>3. Goals can change, because circumstances change</h3>
								<p>My initial goal was to attack the summit regardless of the timing. However, the journey was not as simple as it seems. Nearing the end, the slope was much steeper, it was almost equivalent to the first steep slope hiking at Bukit Timah. Together with high altitude and low oxygen level, it is easy to be out of breath if not control your breathing properly.</p>
								<p>At 7.3 km mark, I have been trying to catch my breath almost every 100m, as I was panting intensely and not controlling my breathing. I was almost out of breathe, and felt I could not reach the summit. At 7.3 km mark, I was thinking of changing my goals and giving up. My junior who has hiked Kota Kinabalu advised me to not push myself if I do not think I can continue further, as it was not worth it. At that point, my goals had changed from securing the summit to securing the 7.5 km distance at the 3.9 km altitude. I was questioning myself if I was affected or not, but I was pretty calm about it. I am aware that I have given my best shot in pushing myself in that circumstances.</p>

								<p>I’m glad that my goal changed again once I realise that the situation has gotten better. I was more acclimatised to the high altitudes, and the weather. Also, the slope was much more gentler, allowing me to hike up further. From there, my goals have re-shifted to push myself to the summit, as I see that I have the energy and capability to reach the top. I know that I have the strength to reach the top, and have decided to push it off further and reach the top.</p>
								<h3>Ending</h3>
								<p>Up until today, I am still amazed at how far I have come , and how I am able to reach the summit over the span of 8.5km distance hike of 4.095 km altitude. It definitely was not an easy journey - securing the top on my first hike. Even if I did not reach the summit, it was still an awesome experience as I have gotten to meet many new people, saw the world, and have dedicated alone to myself to reflect about myself and understand many lessons from this hiking experience here. If anybody ask me they should try solo mountaineering, I would strongly suggest them to do it, provided they have sufficient training. </p>
